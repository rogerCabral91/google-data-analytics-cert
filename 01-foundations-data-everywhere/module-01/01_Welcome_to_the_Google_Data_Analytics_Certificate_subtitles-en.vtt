00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960
What do companies in e-commerce, entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing, marketing, finance,

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.560
tech, and hundreds of other industries all have in common?

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.560
You guessed it.

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.600
They all use data.

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.399
Organizations of all kinds need data analysts to help them improve their processes, identify

6
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:29.940
opportunities and trends, launch new products, provide great customer service, and make thoughtful

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.940
decisions.

8
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.139
Hi, I'm Tony, a program manager at Google and a data analyst myself.

9
00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:39.939
I'd like to welcome you to the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

10
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:44.740
Now, there are lots of great reasons to earn this certificate.

11
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.299
Maybe you're thinking about starting a career in the exciting world of data analytics.

12
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:53.959
Or maybe you're just fascinated by the power of data as I am.

13
00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:58.220
No matter what brought you here, you're in the right place to kickstart a career and

14
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.000
learn industry-relevant skills in data analytics.

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.599
But first, what exactly is data?

16
00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.480
Well, I like to say that data is a collection of facts.

17
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.559
This collection can include numbers, pictures, videos, words, measurements, observations,

18
00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:17.000
and more.

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.720
Once you have data, analytics puts it to work through analysis.

20
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.959
Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw

21
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.980
conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

22
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.260
And it doesn't stop there.

23
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.339
Data evolves over time, which means this analysis, or analytics as we call it, can give us new

24
00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:45.839
information throughout data's entire lifecycle.

25
00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.580
Data is everywhere.

26
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.339
You use and create data every day.

27
00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:55.379
Have you ever read reviews of a product before deciding whether or not to buy it?

28
00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:57.440
That's data analysis.

29
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.900
Or maybe you wear a fitness tracker to count your steps so you can stay active throughout

30
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.900
the day.

31
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.639
That's data analysis.

32
00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:11.100
But you don't just use data, you also create huge amounts of it every single day.

33
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.179
Anytime you use your phone, look up something online, stream music, shop with a credit card,

34
00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:24.100
post on social media, or use GPS to map a route, you're creating data.

35
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.740
Our digital world and the millions of smart devices inside of it have made the amount

36
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.699
of data available truly mind-blowing.

37
00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:38.220
Here at Google, we process more than 40,000 searches every second.

38
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.820
That's 3.5 billion searches a day and 1.2 trillion searches every year.

39
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.500
Here's another way to think about it.

40
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.339
YouTube has almost 2 billion users.

41
00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:54.979
If YouTube users made up a country, it would be the largest in the world.

42
00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.339
All of that data is transforming the world around us.

43
00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:05.080
The publication, The Economist, recently called data the world's most valuable resource.

44
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.179
So it's easy to see why data analysts are so valued by their organizations.

45
00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.419
And what exactly does a data analyst do?

46
00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:19.699
Put simply, a data analyst is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in

47
00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.339
order to help make informed decisions.

48
00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:27.320
Besides the role itself, one of the most exciting parts of being a data analyst is the number

49
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.619
of opportunities available.

50
00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:34.339
The demand for data analysts is greater than the number of qualified people to fill these

51
00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.940
job openings.

52
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.779
And this certificate program is a great first step in your journey to finding a job you

53
00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:42.779
love.

54
00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:48.259
Data analysts come from many different backgrounds and have all kinds of life experiences.

55
00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:54.179
You don't need decades of work experience or an expensive education to get started.

56
00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:59.500
Many data analysts taught themselves the skills they needed to land their first job, just

57
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.860
like you're doing right now.

58
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.460
Okay, now let's talk more about what you're going to learn.

59
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.860
The Google Data Analytics Certificate is split into courses based on different processes

60
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.899
for data analysis.

61
00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:21.260
Those are Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

62
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.299
Plan to watch these videos in order.

63
00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:29.619
Each one covers a new topic and every topic builds on what you've learned before, making

64
00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:32.459
it easy to track your progress.

65
00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.019
And you're in the driver's seat.

66
00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:40.420
Even though you might see things organized by weeks, everything can be completed at your

67
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.779
own pace.

68
00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.299
So you decide how much you want to do each day.

69
00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:50.299
By the end of the program, you'll take everything you've learned and turn it into a project

70
00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:56.500
that you can use to show off your skills and wow hiring managers at your job interviews.

71
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.820
Now along the way, you'll also hear from Googlers.

72
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.739
That's what we call people who work here at Google.

73
00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:07.899
They'll give you an inside look at what it's like to work in our industry and share personal

74
00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:10.980
stories of how they got into the field.

75
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.540
They'll also give you some excellent tips on how to land your dream job.

76
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.820
Stay tuned.

77
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.940
Some of them are going to introduce themselves in just a sec.

78
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.940
So I'm Angie.

79
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.899
I'm a program manager of engineering at Google.

80
00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:28.899
I truly believe that cleaning data is the heart and soul of data.

81
00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:30.660
It's how you get to know your data.

82
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.059
It's quirks, it's flaws, it's mysteries.

83
00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:34.980
I love a good mystery.

84
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.540
And it felt like a superpower almost.

85
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.779
Like I was a detective and I'd gone in there and I'd really solved something.

86
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.380
Hi, I'm Alex.

87
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.700
I'm a research scientist at Google.

88
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:52.660
I research the different impacts of artificial intelligence on society and our users.

89
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.579
So my name is Lila Jones and I am a part of our cloud team.

90
00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:01.899
I get a chance to lead a team of amazing individuals that are focused on helping customers get

91
00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:02.899
to the cloud.

92
00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:03.899
Hi, I'm Evan.

93
00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:06.260
I'm a learning portfolio manager here at Google.

94
00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:10.179
I have one of the coolest jobs in the world where I get to look at all the different technologies

95
00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:14.820
that affect big data and then work them into training courses like this one for students

96
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.820
to take.

97
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.420
I'll be your instructor for the first course.

98
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.739
I'll take you through each module that will cover a specific topic in a few different

99
00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:24.739
ways.

100
00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:29.380
I'm really excited to be guiding you through this course, but I'm especially excited that

101
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.980
you've chosen this adventure.

102
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.779
Lifelong learning is something that I'm very passionate about.

103
00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:40.619
Growing up, when I looked around, I often didn't see many options available to me.

104
00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.220
It wasn't until I started getting serious about my education that I realized I had the

105
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.619
control to make my own opportunities with education being the key that would open those

106
00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:51.899
doors.

107
00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:56.980
The more I learned and the harder I worked, the more possibilities opened up.

108
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.179
Had I not gone after that knowledge and continued challenging myself, I may not be where I am

109
00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:03.880
today.

110
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.040
Lifelong learning allowed me to grow personally, be successful, visit places I would never

111
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.000
have seen, and meet people I would never have known.

112
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.320
And now I'm going to introduce some of those great people.

113
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.359
Hello, I'm Ximena, financial analyst.

114
00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:24.079
I'll be helping you learn how to ask the right questions about data, the project you work

115
00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:26.679
on, and the problems you're trying to solve.

116
00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:29.320
Hey, my name is Hallie, analytical lead.

117
00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:34.519
I am so excited to show you how to prepare your data so it's ready for analysis.

118
00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:38.359
Hello, I'm Sally, measurement and analytical lead.

119
00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:41.559
Together we'll cover how to process and clean your data.

120
00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:44.399
Cleaning data doesn't require soap and water.

121
00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:49.200
I'm talking about making sure your data is complete, correct, and relevant to the problem

122
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.679
you're trying to solve.

123
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.640
Hey, I'm Ayana, global insights manager.

124
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.519
We'll be digging into analysis.

125
00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:01.079
You'll learn how to collect, transform, and organize data so that you can use it to discover

126
00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:05.959
useful information, draw conclusions, and make great decisions.

127
00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:10.359
My name's Kevin, and with my experience as director of analytics at Google, I'll guide

128
00:08:10.359 --> 00:08:16.399
you through what I think is the most exciting part of the data analysis process, plan, create,

129
00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:20.160
and present effective and compelling data visualizations.

130
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.839
Hello, my name is Carrie.

131
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:28.720
I can't wait to tell you about all the exciting things you can do with the programming language R.

132
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.000
Are you ready?

133
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.159
Hi, I'm Rishi, global analytics skills curriculum manager.

134
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.359
I'm going to help you bring together everything you learned during this program by creating

135
00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:43.400
a case study that will dazzle any hiring manager.

136
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.760
Just like the capstone of a great building shows everyone that it's complete, your case

137
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.840
study will signify your own great achievement of earning a Google certificate in data analytics.

138
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.119
Okay, are you getting excited about the potential of becoming a data analyst?

139
00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:01.320
So much is possible with data.

140
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.000
You're about to enter a whole new world.

141
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Ready?

142
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Let's go.
